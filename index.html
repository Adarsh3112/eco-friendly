    <h2>The Era of Eco-Friendly Packging</h2>

        <h3> <b>Plantable Packaging </b> </h3> </b> A piece of packaging that is made of recycled paper and then infused
        with seeds. When this packaging meets soil, the recycled paper decomposes, leaving the seeds behind. This
        zero-waste plantable packaging is made with post-consumer materials embedded with seeds so it will definitely
        show your eco-commitment and promote corporate sustainability.”

      <div class="column">
        <h3><b>Coconut Husk</b></h3></b> The husk of a coconut, known as Coir, is a natural fibre found between the
        shell and outer layer of the coconut. When pressed, this fibrous material can be formed into packing which can
        often look liike cardboard.
        The husks separated from the nuts are retted in lagoons up to ten months. The retted husks are then beaten with
        wooden mallets manually to produce the golden fibre. The fibre is later spun into yarn on traditional spinning
        wheels called “Ratts”, ready for dyeing and weaving into myriad shades of floor coverings.

        <h3><b>Rice Husk</b></h3></b>
        Rice husk is a renewable material that has a high silicon content and can be used as a substitute for styrene
        material in the packaging of electronic items in its packaging.rice husk has also been widely accepted to be
        degradable in natural soil environment because the main components of it are susceptible to the complex of
        microorganisms present in soil. A method for manufacturing a container from rice husk includes the steps of
        comminuting the husk into powder form, mixing the powder with an edible adhesive, with the introduction of
        steam, to form a paste, forming a blank from the paste, shaping the blank into a primary semi-product,
        re-shaping the primary semi-product to the desired one.

        <h3><b>Mushroom Packaging</b></h3></b>
        Mushroom Packaging is simply made with 2 ingredients: hemp hurds and mycelium. A high-performing packaging
        solution, cost-competitive, thermally insulating, and water-resistant. Add to the soil to compost in 45 days .
        Mushroom Packaging consists of 100 percent biodegradable and renewable material that can be recycled directly in
        and by nature. The entire process takes 8-9 days to complete from start to finish, with two 4-5 day waiting
        periods.

        <h3><b>Corn Starch</b></h3></b>
        Corn starch packaging is 30 percent stronger than existing polythene bags. Because they are biodegradable, corn
        starch bags are likely to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and represent a niche market for new
        entrants that could attract a core customer base.Cornstarch is also effective as food packaging since it is 100%
        food-safe, has a high aroma barrier, and resistance to food fat and oils without the use of coatings or
        chemicals. Furthermore, cornstarch packaging has low flammability, and the material lends itself well to
        printing applications.
